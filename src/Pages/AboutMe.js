                    <p className='text-accent'>Hi! I am Sadia Tuz Johora. I live in the Unites States of America.</p>
                    <p className="py-6 text-primary">Thinking of starting a career in Web Development was not an easy decision.
                        The path I took to become a Junior Web Developer was extremely thrilling and exciting for me.
                        I took a 180-degree turn from my educational background and started this journey.</p>
                    <p className='text-success'>  Currently, I am looking for opportunities to further my knowledge in this field.
                        As I have made so far and have acquired knowledge of basic web development,
                        I strongly believe I will be able to secure my career as a Web Developer soon.
                        Some of my projects are added in this website,
                        feel free to take a look. </p>
